    <h1>Welcome to my Athanaeum.</h1>
      <p>
      Thanks for visiting my corner of the internet. This space is a collection of my current explorations, experiments, and maybe some discoveries.
      I'm constantly looking to improve myself, and one way I've found to do so and solidify my understanding is attempting to teach it.
      Without someone to directly teach to, maybe this blog will help me teach myself in a manner. Hopefully those who stumble across this site will feel the same.
      And perhaps teaching may not be the best word, but I digress.

      <p>
      Please note going forward, some of these blog posts will be based on things I've learned or in the process of learning from other individuals.
      I will do my best to make sure that associated links and references are included to ensure that one, credit is given where credit is due, and two provides whom ever is reading these with additional source of informaiton, rather than my possibly terrible ramblings.

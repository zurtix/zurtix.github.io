      <h3 class="md:text-2xl text-md">Welcome</h3>
      <p>
      Thanks for visiting my corner of the internet. This space is a collection of my current explorations, experiments, and maybe some discoveries.
      I'm constantly looking to improve myself, and one way I've found to do so and solidify my understanding is attempting to teach it.
      Without someone to directly teach to, maybe this blog will help me teach myself in a manner. Hopefully those who stumble across this site will feel the same.
        </p>

# The Blog
Have I ever create a blog before? <span>no</span>.

Why would I bother creating one while there are possibly thousands of others that already do the same? <span class="text-primary"> I find one of the best ways to learn something is attempting to explain what you've learned. What better a place to do so than a blog which I can also leverage as an archive of my past learnings and projects.</span>

## How was this site built?

This site was generated utilizing Astro, and for those who aren't familiar with it, check it out [here](https://astro.build/).
Along with Astro I am utilizing [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for some components and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for my styling.

So why Astro? Well, because I heard of it through a friend, seen a few things about it on YouTube, and figured - why not leverage it for a static website. I would not call myself a big web developer... infact, I use to hate it with a passion, and utilizing Astro has made it seem relatively easy - so far. I guess you could say another reason to use Astro was to get familiar with some new framework and that's kind of the idea for this whole blog, which leads me to my next point.

## What went into the choice of building a blog site?

Try some new things, fail, succeed, fail some more, succeed some more, rinse repeat. There's always so much new stuff out there to stumble across, so much to learn, yet so little time. I'd like to think that this blog at some point would give me a way to leave my mark on the world. I love explaining my thought (or try to, english is a very hard langugae even as a first one). And with those thoughts I'd like to share them to the community to put things into perhaps a different perspective. We all have a brain, but it works in many different ways. What might make sense to me may or may not make sense with you, and vice versa.

Some of the other decisions besides sharing with the broader community is giving myself a sense of direction. I don't know about you, but sometimes I have a hard time trying to figure out what to work on next. It has always been a huge problem for me as I shoot myself down when trying to start something new all the time. If you suffer from the same thing as I do, then try giving a blog a shot! At least it will give you a chance to code something while you think of your next big project.

# rel0909_x64-86.exe Malware

The sample in question is capable of hosting a web endpoint on an infected host machine. This works in a manner of creating an HTTP server for threat actors to connect and issue commands via web sockets. Once commands are received, an interpreter developed by Traefik called Yaegi is being leveraged to execute malicious payloads to further progress the infection of the host.

## Reversing

Starting off with this sample, we can see through DIE (Detect it Easy) that the application is written in Go.

![Detect it Easy](/rel0909/detect_it_easy.png)

Whether you consider it lucky or not, this sample is also already identified in VT as malicious. However not a lot of details are shared there.

![VirusTotal](/rel0909/virustotal.png)

If we do a quick look into the sections we can see that the `.symtab` section exists. However, unfortunately for us this actually appears to be empty. This will make it more difficult to reverse engineer, but we can leverage things like Ghidra scripts in an effort to recover some of the symbols.

![PE Bear](/rel0909/pe_bear_symtab.png)

Before opening Ghidra or x64dbg, I'd recommend downloading and configuring the following. I wont go over how these are installed as both repos contain the documentation to do so. 

For Ghidra
https://github.com/advanced-threat-research/GhidraScripts

For x64dbg
https://github.com/mooncat-greenpy/x64dbg_GolangAnalyzerPlugin

These two items will greatly easy the reverse engineering side of things. The Ghidra scripts will attempt to recover all possible functions names, structs, strings, etc from the application itself, considering we don't have a filled `.symtab` this will help immensely. The plugin for x64dbg will do something in a similar sense making it easier for us to identify user functions by their name as well as add references to line numbers linking it back to where in the user code it is found.

Let's now take a look in Ghidra, before executing our scripts, at the malware. We can see that none of the function names are present. This would make it, not impossible, but much more challenging to reverse engineer.

![Entry not Recovered](/rel0909/entry_not_recovered.png)

 Run the `GoLangRecovery.java` script which will execute `GoLangFunctionRecovery`, `GoLangStaticStringRecovery`, `GoLangDynamicStringRecovery`, and `GoLangTypeRecovery`. Once this script has completed it's execution - we can see within the decompiler window, we now have symbols. We can see this just from the entry point alone as it has changed drastically. 

![Ghidra Scripts](/rel0909/ghidra_scripts.png)

![Entry Point](/rel0909/entry_point.png)

Now that symbols are loaded we can jump into the functions window and look for the `main.main` function. The actual starting point of the application within the Go runtime.

![Function Main](/rel0909/function_main.png)

Looking into the main function, there are several interesting things to investigate. First of all, a handler is being setup against the `/` endpoint. The details of which we will get into further in the write up.

![Handler Setup](/rel0909/handler_setup.png)

Following the call to setup the endpoint, an HTTP listening server is setup. Before the server is setup, the host and port is pulled from the string `ppcVar1`. The string may appear to be very long, but looking at the line prior to where the string is assigned we can see the hex value `0xE` equates to `14` in decimal. This is the same length of `localhost:8531`. With the string obtained, it is passed to `ListenAndServe`.

![Listen and Server Setup](/rel0909/listen_and_server_setup.png)

Once the server has been successfully stood up. The resulting response or error is placed into the `auVar9` variable. Based on documentation, the only value returned from this call is an error.

https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#ListenAndServe

The potential error is being leveraged within a `while` to check if a valid error occurred i.e. `!= 0`. In the event that an error was raised, the loop will sleep for 10 seconds or `10000000000` nanoseconds as we can see. Followed by subsequent calls to create the listening server again. This will happen indefinitely until a successful listener is stood up.

![While error Setup Server](/rel0909/while_error_setup_server.png)

Now that we understand the of how `main` operates, we can confirm that the purpose of this is to setup an `HTTP` listener on a `localhost:8531` with the endpoint `/` in order for a handler to accept communications. 

Since we have a general idea that web requests will be made to the host on `/`. We now need to take a look further into the function provided to `wsHandler`. In order to do that we we will follow the function pointer starting from `0xf081e8`.

![Function Pointer](/rel0909/function_pointer.png)

![Main WS Hnalder PTR](/rel0909/main_ws_handler_ptr.png)

Starting off in the `wsHandler` function, a call to `Upgrade` is being made using github.com/gorilla/websocket. As you can probably already tell, this means we have identified an external library leveraging the usage of web sockets in order to communicate back with the `HTTP` listener. The `Upgrade` call itself provides a mechanism to upgrade an established connection. This will allow the server to upgrade the protocol for further communications.

![Websocket Upgrade](/rel0909/websocket_upgrade.png)

Scrolling through the `wsHandler` assembly/decompiled code we can see a few other functions that may catch the eye. First with `ReadMessage` inside of a do while loop. This should make it obvious to us that an expected result is meant to occur after a message is read. Meaning the threat actor will need to make an appropriate call through a web socket in order for the message to be read.

![Read Message](/rel0909/read_message.png)

After `ReadMessage`, further down we can see calls to `encoding/json.Unmarshal`. This gives the impression that perhaps once `ReadMessage` is successfully executed - the results of which are `Unmarshal` from `json` into a `struct`. From the address found within the function call itself, `0xD49FC0` points to a pointer of a possible struct `*main.Command`. Investigating the runtime call for a `newobject` just before the `Unmarshal`, we can identify this struct and it's possible values.

![Newobject and Unmarshal](/rel0909/newobject_and_unmarshall.png)

![Address Main Command](/rel0909/address_main_command.png)

![Main Command Struct](/rel0909/main_command_struct.png)

Now that the struct has been identified, later on we could possibly leverage this information in an attempt at reverse engineering the calls made to the infected host.

```go
type *main.Command struct {
	Type *string
	Payload *string
	Args *string
	Uuid *string
}
```

Following the calls to `Unmarhsal`, calls to `Sum256` and `Decrypt` function can be found. 

![Sum256 Decrypt](/rel0909/sum256_decrypt.png)

With the function `stringtoslicebyte` being called prior to `Sum256` and based on the Go documentation demonstrating the `Sum256` function accepts a byte array is provided, we can safely assume this function will leverage data stored on the stack as a result of the `stringtoslicebyte` call. 

https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/sha256#Sum256

After the `Sum256` call completes, `Decrypt` is immediately ran passing in a number of variables. Taking a look at the decompiled code for `Decrypt` we can see the next important function call is to `DecodeString`. This `DecodeString` function comes from `encoding/base64` library leveraged to take a `base64` encoded string and decode it to `plaintext`. 

![Base64 Decode](/rel0909/base64_decode.png)

Since we are dealing with encryption here, I would fully expect this decoded plain text to result in cipher text. Something that we cannot read without progressing further into the decryption phase. 

With successful decoding from base64 format `aes.NewCipher` is called. Typically we would only see one argument based on the Go documentation, Ghidra has made a bit of a mess so we can investigate this further later on.

![Aes New Cipher](/rel0909/aes_new_cipher.png)

With the variable initialised using `NewCipher`. Direct calls to the `newCFB` function are made. Typically users would make calls to the higher level function `NewCFBDecrypter`. However, in this case, the sample leverages the direct call to `newCFB`, which is the underlying function within `NewCFBEncrypter` & `NewCFBDecrypter`. It is not documented on the documents page, but I did find it within the source code.

https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.23.2:src/crypto/cipher/cfb.go;drc=a0da9c00aeb51261b9845a46fbc9878870884ab6;l=67

As a result, once the `newCFB` runs through the decryption stage, the bytes get converted into a string and is returned to the calling instruction.

![Decrypt New CFB](/rel0909/decrypt_new_cfb.png)

With the newly created decrypted payload string returned. The malware leverages Yaegi. Yaegi as defined on their github page as, "Another Elegant Go Interpreter. It powers executable Go scripts and plugins, in embedded interpreters or interactive shells, on top of the Go runtime". https://github.com/traefik/yaegi

And as we can see there are a fair number of usages in the sample. Firstly a call to `New` which will generate a new embedded interpreter. 

![Yaegi New](/rel0909/yaegi_new.png)

The interpreter is then combined with calls to `Use` which in this case relate to imports from Yaegi's `stdlib`. Based on what I was able to find under an assumption and looking at the references to the `DAT_` variables, I came to the following conclusions. 

`DAT_015eb698` stdlib.Symbols https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/traefik/yaegi/stdlib
`DAT_015eb6a8` stdlib.unrestricted.Symbols https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/traefik/yaegi@v0.16.1/stdlib/unrestricted


![Use DAT Symbols](/rel0909/use_dat_symbols.png)

![DAT 1](/rel0909/dat_1.png)
![DAT 2](/rel0909/dat_2.png)

Taking a look at `stdlib.unrestricted.Symbols` in the GitHub repository, we can see a number of possible functions available from this lib. https://github.com/traefik/yaegi/blob/v0.16.1/stdlib/unrestricted/unrestricted.go

![Unrestricted Symbols](/rel0909/unrestricted_symbols.png)

This certainly gives the impression that what ever is decrypted from the payload is obviously Go code. Not only Go code, but code specifically crafted with the functions defined above in mind. 

Post this setup of the interpreter, the decrypted data is then ran through the `eval` function of the interpreter, resulting in the execution of the code.

![Eval 1](/rel0909/eval_1.png)

## Debugging

Opening the malware in `x64dbg` and with the previously mentioned Go plugin, we will first need to run the following commands, 

`GoAnalyzer.line.enable`
`GoAnalyzer.analyze`

Now the debugger can be started.

Once the first break point is hit, we can run until the second break point in the entry is hit.

![Starting Point](/rel0909/starting_point.png)

![rt0_amd64](/rel0909/rt0_amd64.png)

Since Go uses a runtime, it can be a little convoluted to get to the `main`. However, following the next set of screenshots will follow a path in order to get there.

![Step 1](/rel0909/step_1.png)

![Step 2](/rel0909/step_2.png)

![Step 3](/rel0909/step_3.png)

![Step 4](/rel0909/step_4.png)

![Step 5](/rel0909/step_5.png)

![Step 6](/rel0909/step_6.png)

![Step 7](/rel0909/step_7.png)

![Step 8](/rel0909/step_8.png)

![Step 9](/rel0909/step_9.png)

![Step 10](/rel0909/step_10.png)

Once we have hit the `jmp rbx` we will step into the jump (this jump will be taken multiple times). Looking further down into this and the series of calls below it we can see where `&main.main` is pushed into `rax`. Following this a `call` is performed on `rax` resulting in the `main` execution. 

![Call RAX](/rel0909/call_rax.png)

![DBG Main](/rel0909/dbg_main.png)

Now within the main, we can set a break point on `HandleFunc` and once it's loaded into `rcx` we can access it's memory. From here we can place a break point to get hit. 

![Handle Func Breakpoint](/rel0909/handle_func_breakpoint.png)

![WS Handler Memory Breakpoint](/rel0909/ws_handler_meomry_breakpoint.png)

Before heading further into the debug stage, I am going to leverage the following code to interact with the listening server. 

```bash
python3 -m pip install websockets
```

Creating the following `sender.py` file with the contents, 

```python
import websocket
import json

payload = {
    "Type": "type",
    "Payload": "payload", 
    "Args": "args",
    "Uuid": "uuid"
}

print("[+] Running payload: ")
print(json.dumps(payload))

websocket.enableTrace(True)
ws = websocket.create_connection("ws://localhost:8531/")

ws.send(json.dumps(payload))
ws.recv()

```

Once we run the `python sender.py` command from a CLI, we can continue debugging the malware. Landing within the `wsHandler` function call.

![WS Handler DBG](/rel0909/ws_handler_dbg.png)

In order to prevent the remainder of the malware from crashing and raising an exception. It's important to remove a previously set break point.

![Remove Break Point](/rel0909/remove_break_point.png)

Now that we're in the `wsHandler` function we can take a look around to see what the next calls may be. As you can see, there are a number of calls that have been seen before in the reverse engineering portion of this write up done in Ghidra. It's up to you how you do your reverse engineering process, but I always find it helpful to have Ghidra open side by side with my x64dbg to follow along in the decompiled code. Makes things a bit easier.

With break points set at the `Upgrade` and `ReadMessage` functions we can run continue twice. Once to jump to the `Upgrade` function, then again to land on `ReadMessage`.

![WS Hnalder Upgrade Read Message](/rel0909/ws_handler_upgrade_read_message.png)

Once landed on `ReadMessage`, taking one step over to the next call we can begin to see that our payload was successfully read into memory.

![Payload in RBX](/rel0909/payload_in_rbx.png)

With our payload now in memory, the malware can begin to unmarshal. 

![Unmarhsal](/rel0909/unmarshal.png)

Once the unmarshal is complete we can see the value being pulled into `rdx`. Based on the register, looking at it in the dump, are the reflect addresses in little endian to the data itself along with the length of the string. 

![Unmarshal RDX](/rel0909/unmarshal_rdx.png)

As we look through the next set of assembly instructions, we can see that the length of the string`[rdx+8]` is being placed into `rsi`. Following this the qword value stored in `0x000000C000304124` which equates to `type` as defined by our payload, is moved into `rdi`. After these moves occur there are two comparisons that are made against these registers.  

`cmp rsi,2`  This comparison will check to see if the length of our `Type` value is equal to two.

`cmp word ptr ds:[rdi], 6F64` Looking at what `6F64` represents in hex as an ASCII value leaves us with `do`. This line compares the value we have in `Type` which is `type` against the value `do`.

![Compare Operation](/rel0909/compare_operation.png)

Before moving onto the next steps, we will need to modify our payload that we are sending against the web socket to properly represent this new found data. Once our payload is updated, and our debugger is restarted, we can begin debugging this sample again.

```python
import websocket
import json

payload = {
    "Type": "do", # Static value set to cmp word ptr ds:[rdi], 6F64
    "Payload": "payload", 
    "Args": "args",
    "Uuid": "uuid"
}

print("[+] Running payload: ")
print(json.dumps(payload))

websocket.enableTrace(True)
ws = websocket.create_connection("ws://localhost:8531/")

ws.send(json.dumps(payload))
ws.recv()
```

After successfully passing these compare cases, we now move onto a `stringslicetobytes` function. Which is called prior to `Sum256`. The `stringslicetobytes` is being called on the value stored in `rbx` which at the time will be our value `uuid` based on `ds:[rdx+30]` (`rdx` being the base address where the json object is stored). This function call will simply result in moving `uuid` into the `rax` register.

![RDX UUID](/rel0909/rdx_uuid.png)

With `uuid` now in the `rax` register, `Sum256` is called on it in order to create, you guessed it, a SHA 256 hash stored in `rsp`.

![SHA256 Sum](/rel0909/sha256_sum.png)

![SHA256 Proof](/rel0909/sha256_proof.png)

Next we have the `Decrypt` function. This function is being performed on data found within the `Payload` of our payload. With a similar situations as before, `payload` is being pulled in from `ds:[rdx+10]` (`rdx` being the base address of where our json object is stored)  into `rax`. Another interesting thing to notice here before diving into the `Decrypt` function is the `mov edi,20`. If we take a look at what `20` represents in hex we will find it equates to decimal value `32`. If you have experience with `AES` encryption techniques you'll find this peculiar as a hint towards a 32-bit key. 

![Pre Decrypt](/rel0909/pre_decrypt.png)

Now, taking a look inside the `Decrypt` function, we can see many things happening. First we have a `DecodeString` from the `encoding/base64` library. Since our payload is not appropriately created to successfully pass this call, we will need to make more changes to this script. However, before we go ahead and do that, let's take a look at what is being passed into the `call aes.NewCipher`.

![Decrypt Inner](/rel0909/decrypt_inner.png)

Continuing until we hit the `DecodeString` function, we will allow the DecodeString to complete by stepping over. This will result in an error as our `Payload` is not in `base64` format. However, for now we will step over until the `jne` call. Once on the `jne` call, we can modify the `ZF` from `0` to `1` to allow our debugger to continue into the sub calls. 

![ZF Change](/rel0909/zf_change.png)

Stepping over or continuing until we hit `NewCipher` call, we can identify the value being passed in as the `key` which is being stored in `rcx` which we can see is the 256 sum of `uuid`. We know that a `key` is being passed in based on the documentation found here, https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/aes#NewCipher. 

![Decrypt With Key](/rel0909/decrypt_with_key.png)

Since we already have a lot of information from the reverse engineering portion we will try to replicate the encryption process. In order to replicate the encryption process I've written the following code in Go. I decided to write this in Go instead of Python to get a learning experience in writing code for Go as well as trying to mimic as best as possible how this would look from the threat actor's end. 


```go
package main

import (
	"bytes"
	"crypto/aes"
	"crypto/cipher"
	"crypto/rand"
	"crypto/sha256"
	"encoding/base64"
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"strings"
)

func removeBase64Padding(value string) string {
	return strings.Replace(value, "=", "", -1)
}

func Pad(src []byte) []byte {
	padding := aes.BlockSize - len(src)%aes.BlockSize
	padtext := bytes.Repeat([]byte{byte(padding)}, padding)
	return append(src, padtext...)
}

func encrypt(key []byte, text string) (string, error) {
	block, err := aes.NewCipher(key)
	if err != nil {
		return "", err
	}

	msg := Pad([]byte(text))
	ciphertext := make([]byte, aes.BlockSize+len(msg))
	iv := ciphertext[:aes.BlockSize]
	if _, err := io.ReadFull(rand.Reader, iv); err != nil {
		return "", err
	}

	cfb := cipher.NewCFBEncrypter(block, iv)
	cfb.XORKeyStream(ciphertext[aes.BlockSize:], []byte(msg))
	finalMsg := base64.URLEncoding.EncodeToString(ciphertext)
	return finalMsg, nil
}

func genKey(key string) []byte {
	h := sha256.New()
	h.Write([]byte(key))
	return h.Sum(nil)
}

type command struct {
	Type    string
	Payload string
	Args    string
	Uuid    string
}

func main() {
	rawKey := "uuid"
	key := genKey(rawKey)

	src := `package main
	import (
    	    "os/exec"
	)
	
	func main() { 
	    cmd := exec.Command("calc.exe")
	    cmd.Start()
	}`

	encryptMsg, _ := encrypt(key, src)

	c := &command{
		Type:    "do",
		Payload: encryptMsg,
		Args:    "",
		Uuid:    rawKey,
	}

	b, err := json.Marshal(c)

	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Println(string(b))
}
```

With the code now developed, we can run within the Go Playground or use a compiler installed on a host. https://go.dev/play/

As a result we obtain the following result which we can update in our `sender.py` script in order to communicate with the malware.

```json
{"Type":"do","Payload":"eXKWsNUZvl2hRtGKLi_NVdzlgOZHlnSZPHKIaJ_1pLlxgpD4Z2QqaaSpkCBrg1fnUyzg_Xmmj9K1HhGKxtEvTVWWKRIySSJsuuuvZzn82wg6DAZj5TdcW1KmqeeUXn5snuNfv-dPjEWTTi9BHPftKhrhnrJnQf5Jjx-G_Llqbicnvz2ENrPIpC9t7sE_4jvE","Args":"","Uuid":"uuid"}
```

```python
import websocket
import json

payload = {"Type":"do","Payload":"eXKWsNUZvl2hRtGKLi_NVdzlgOZHlnSZPHKIaJ_1pLlxgpD4Z2QqaaSpkCBrg1fnUyzg_Xmmj9K1HhGKxtEvTVWWKRIySSJsuuuvZzn82wg6DAZj5TdcW1KmqeeUXn5snuNfv-dPjEWTTi9BHPftKhrhnrJnQf5Jjx-G_Llqbicnvz2ENrPIpC9t7sE_4jvE","Args":"","Uuid":"uuid"}

print("[+] Running payload: ")
print(json.dumps(payload))

websocket.enableTrace(True)
ws = websocket.create_connection("ws://localhost:8531/")

ws.send(json.dumps(payload))
ws.recv()
```

From this point we can restart the debugger and continue until we've hit the `ListenAndServe` function. While the malware is waiting for a web request, we will issue our payload via `python sender.py`.  Once the break point is hit inside of the `wsHandler` we can continue until we hit the `Decrypt` call. Issuing a single step over, we can confirm that our `Payload` was successfully decrypted and stored within `rax`.

![Successful Decrypt](/rel0909/successful_decrypt.png)

Continuing until we hit the 'eval' function of `github.com/traefik/yaegi/interp` will now attempt to evaluate and execute our `Payload` containing our Go code to execute a `calc.exe`. 

Stepping into the `eval` function we can see that at `CompileSrc` is where the interpreter will attempt to read the code we've sent it in `rbx`. If successfully read taking the successful `jne` the code will be ran through the `Execute` call, spawning our `calc.exe`.

![Eval Call](/rel0909/eval_call.png)

![Compile Src](/rel0909/compile_src.png)

![Eecute](/rel0909/execute.png)

![Calc Opened](/rel0909/calc_opened.png)

As we can see this malware allows us to execute unrestricted Go code. Resulting in the furthering of an infection of the host itself utilising the embedded `Yaegi` interpreter.


## Additional notes

Unfortunately since the original payloads were not acquired, it is difficult to determine what the next steps of this malware really are. For example there are additional calls to `eval` being made to what appears to be a Go package called `smth`. Within this package contains a function `bdbfeabcbeacaefabbd`. I believe the first `eval` call would have contained the package `smth` with all it's function definitions & variables, followed by this call `smth.bdbfeabcbeacaefabbd` in order to begin the execution.

![smth Package](/rel0909/smth_package.png)

<span class="text-xl">The Blog</span>
<br />
<br />
Have I ever create a blog before? <span class="text-primary">no</span>.<br />
<br />
Why would I bother creating one while there are possibly thousands of others
that already do the same? <span class="text-primary">
  {" "}
  I find one of the best ways to learn something is attempting to explain what
  you've learned. What better a place to do so than a blog which I can also
  leverage as an archive of my past learnings and projects.

<br />
<br />
<span class="text-xl">How was this site built?</span>
<br />
<br />
This site was generated utilizing Astro, and for those who aren't familiar with
it, check it out <a class="text-primary" href="https://astro.build/">
  here
</a>
. Along with Astro I am utilizing <a
  href="https://ui.shadcn.com/"
  class="text-primary"
>
  Shadcn
</a> for some components and <a
  href="https://tailwindcss.com/"
  class="text-primary"
>
  Tailwindcss
</a> for my styling.
<br />
<br />
So why Astro? Well, because I heard of it through a friend, seen a few things
about it on YouTube, and figured - why not leverage it for a static website. I
would not call myself a big web developer... infact, I use to hate it with a
passion, and utilizing Astro has made it seem relatively easy - so far. I guess
you could say another reason to use Astro was to get familiar with some new
framework and that's kind of the idea for this whole blog, which leads me to my
next point.

<br />
<span class="text-xl">What went into the choice of building a blog site?</span>
<br />
<br />
Try some new things, fail, succeed, fail some more, succeed some more, rinse
repeat. There's always so much new stuff out there to stumble across, so much to
learn, yet so little time. I'd like to think that this blog at some point would
give me a way to leave my mark on the world. I love explaining my thought (or
try to, english is a very hard langugae even as a first one). And with those
thoughts I'd like to share them to the community to put things into perhaps a
different perspective. We all have a brain, but it works in many different ways.
What might make sense to me may or may not make sense with you, and vice versa.
<br />
<br />
Some of the other decisions besides sharing with the broader community is giving
myself a sense of direction. I don't know about you, but sometimes I have a hard
time trying to figure out what to work on next. It has always been a huge
problem for me as I shoot myself down when trying to start something new all the
time. If you suffer from the same thing as I do, then try giving a blog a shot!
At least it will give you a chance to code something while you think of your
next big project.

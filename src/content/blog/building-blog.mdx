Init  
Have I ever create a blog before, no?  
Why would I bother creating one while there are possibly thousands of others that already do the same? To enhance my learning and better showcase my ideas and projects.
I find the best way that I learn is to obtain some of the knowledge, attempt to teach or explain my thought, and either be completely wrong and revisit the subject, or try to express myself in a way that I need to do more research. And why not at the same time have an archive of my learning and see how far I've grown!<br/><br/>

<span class="text-xl">Init</span><br/><br/>
Have I ever create a blog before? <span class="text-primary">no</span>.  
Why would I bother creating one while there are possibly thousands of others that already do the same? <span class="text-primary">To enhance my learning and better showcase my ideas and projects.
I find the best way that I learn is to obtain some of the knowledge, attempt to teach or explain my thought, and either be completely wrong and revisit the subject, or try to express myself in a way that I need to do more research. And why not at the same time have an archive of my learning and see how far I've grown</span>!<br/><br/>
<span class="text-xl">How was zurtix.github.io built?</span><br/><br/>
This site was generated utilizing Astro, and for those who aren't familiar with it, check it out <a class="text-primary" href="https://astro.build/">here</a>.
Along with Astro I am utilizing <a href="https://ui.shadcn.com/" class="text-primary">Shadcn</a> for some components and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" class="text-primary">Tailwindcss</a> for my styling.<br/><br/>
So why Astro? Well, because I heard of it through a friend, seen a few things about it on YouTube, and figure why not leverage it for a static website?
I would not call myself a big web developer... infact, I use to hate it with a passion. Now it's not so bad. So another reason for me was to get familiar with some new web things. That being Astro.<br/><br/>
